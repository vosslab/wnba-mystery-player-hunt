# for everyone, no npm knowledge required. The npm run serve alias is an

# Always serves dist/ (the GitHub Pages artifact). Never serves the
# repo root or _site/.
#
# Lifecycle: this script owns ONLY the processes it starts -- the
# http.server child and its own delayed browser-open helper. An
# idempotent cleanup trap kills only those two PIDs on exit. It never
# scans for or kills any process it did not start (no pkill/pgrep/ps,
# no PID file). Residual: SIGKILL of this script is untrappable, so a
# kill -9 can still orphan the child; that is an inherent shell limit.
