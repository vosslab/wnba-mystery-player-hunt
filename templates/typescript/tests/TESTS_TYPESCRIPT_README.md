# TypeScript app quickstart

## What this repo is

This is a TypeScript browser app. You write code in `src/`, bundle it into
`dist/`, and ship `dist/` to GitHub Pages. A small set of named shell scripts
is the whole interface: drive the repo through them and you never need to open
`package.json`. The npm aliases (`npm run build`, `serve`, `check`, `clean`,
`test:playwright`) mirror the scripts one to one as an optional convenience.

## Front door shell scripts

| Script | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `./check_codebase.sh` | Fast gate: typecheck, lint, format check, Node unit tests. |
| `./build_github_pages.sh` | Bundle `src/` into `dist/` (the Pages artifact). |
| `./run_web_server.sh` | Build `dist/`, serve a local preview on a random port. |
| `./run_playwright_tests.sh` | Run browser tests; builds `dist/` as needed. |
| `./dist_clean.sh` | Wipe `dist/`. |

Run `./check_codebase.sh --help` for usage. `./run_web_server.sh` picks a
random port each run so the browser cache stays fresh; set `PORT` to override.
`./run_playwright_tests.sh` lets Playwright's own `webServer` config start the
test server, and accepts `--build` to force a rebuild first.

## Repo layout you edit

- `src/main.ts` is the entry point (use `src/main.tsx` for JSX or Solid).
- `src/index.html` is the page shell that loads `dist/main.js`.
- `src/style.css` holds the styles, copied into `dist/` at build time.
- `dist/` is the generated bundle; treat it as build output, not source.
- `tests/` holds every test tier described below.

## Test tiers and homes

The repo has four test tiers. Pick the home by what you are testing.

- Fast pytest hygiene under `tests/` covers markdown links, ASCII compliance,
  and file naming. These are cross-ecosystem checks, not the TypeScript
  toolchain. Run them with `pytest tests/`. One guard, the test naming check,
  enforces test file naming under `tests/e2e/` and `tests/playwright/`.
- Node unit tests live in `tests/test_*.mjs`. Add one by dropping a
  `test_<name>.mjs` into `tests/`; `./check_codebase.sh` picks it up
  automatically through `node --import tsx --test 'tests/test_*.mjs'`.
- Browser tests live under `tests/playwright/`. Run them with
  `./run_playwright_tests.sh`. See `docs/PLAYWRIGHT_USAGE.md` for the browser
  test conventions.
- Whole-system E2E lives under `tests/e2e/` and runs directly, excluded from
  pytest. See `E2E_TESTS.md` for the non-browser E2E conventions.

## Daily run order

A typical edit loop runs the tiers in this order:

- Edit files under `src/`.
- Run `./check_codebase.sh` for the fast gate.
- Run `./run_web_server.sh` and eyeball the app in a browser.
- Run `./run_playwright_tests.sh` to confirm browser behavior.

## Ship to GitHub Pages

- Run `./build_github_pages.sh` to emit `dist/`, including `dist/.nojekyll` so
  Pages serves files whose names start with an underscore.
- Deploy runs as a GitHub Action from `dist/`. The seed workflow ships as a
  root-level `deploy-pages.yml`; move it into your repository workflows
  directory to activate it.
- Once the site is live, link `https://<owner>.github.io/<repo>/` near the top
  of `README.md` so readers can open the app in one click.

## Common first run failures

- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.lint.json` exits with TS18003 when `tests/` and `tools/`
  contain no `.ts` files. Seed a small `.ts` stub or narrow the include list in
  the consumer-owned `tsconfig.lint.json`.
- Playwright needs `dist/` built before it serves the app. The runner
  auto-builds when `dist/` is missing, or pass `--build` to force a rebuild.
- A fresh `npm install` must run esbuild's postinstall step. The `allowScripts`
  block in `package.json` already permits it, so let the install complete.

## Where to add tests

Keep the TypeScript toolchain checks (typecheck, lint, format, Node tests)
inside `./check_codebase.sh`, and keep the pytest tier under `tests/` thin and
cross-ecosystem. That split keeps each ecosystem verified by its own tools.
