e2e_reset_routing.py - clone-based end-to-end harness for reset_repo.py.

Drives reset_repo.py against REAL git clones of the template, one per case, and
verifies the on-disk result against the live propagation engine plus a set of
reset-specific anchor checks. Two clone modes are supported:

  - LOCAL (default): clone the local checkout (committed history only). Offline,
    fast, validates committed local state. This is the pre-commit inner loop.
  - REMOTE: clone the published github https URL. Needs network, read-only, no
    ssh. Validates origin/main, what a real consumer clones.

Mode is chosen by a command-line argument:

    source source_me.sh && python3 tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py          # LOCAL
    source source_me.sh && python3 tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py remote   # REMOTE

Because a `git clone` copies only COMMITTED history, LOCAL mode exercises the
reset_repo.py that is committed in the local checkout. If a new reset_repo.py
feature (for example --config) is only in the working tree and not yet
committed, the cloned reset will lack it and the harness reports the failure.

For each inline case the harness clones into a reused, consumer-named /tmp dir
(e.g. /tmp/reset_e2e_python, NEVER starter-repo-template, so the reset
folder-name guard passes), writes the case reset config to a short-lived json
file, runs `reset_repo.py --config <file>` inside the clone, removes the json,
then asserts:

  (a) the engine-derived propagated-file set is present on disk, and
  (b) the reset-specific anchors hold (template-meta removed, REPO_TYPE marker,
      license installed, pyproject seeded iff PyPI, stale submit_to_pypi
      cleaned, stage/commit state).

This is a tests/meta/e2e/ runner: it lives outside pytest, excluded by its
e2e_ filename prefix (pytest collects only test_*.py); tests/conftest.py also
lists meta/e2e in collect_ignore as defense in depth. It is self-contained,
uses real git in a /tmp dir, may use asserts, and exits non-zero on the
first mismatch.
Template-meta: never propagates to consumers; removed by reset.
