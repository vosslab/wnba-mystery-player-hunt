# Propagation rules

Where to drop a file so the propagator ships it to the right repos.

See [HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md](HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md) for durable propagation decisions and design rationale.

## Hardcoding principles

Manifests live in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` (loaded by `repolib/manifests.py:load_manifests()`
and assigned to `repolib/model.py` module-level names). Three hardcoding categories apply:

- **Good hardcoding** -- root files with special semantics, noexist files, exclude_repos exceptions.
  These need explicit intent because no directory convention can express them.
- **Expected hardcoding** -- root allowlist, root meta files. Root has mixed semantics (some ship,
  some don't, some need bootstrap-time customization); per-file lists are correct.
- **Bad hardcoding** -- files classifiable by directory listed individually. Move them to a
  META_DIRS entry. Example: `tools/detect_repo_type.py` lived in META_FILES; now `tools` is in
  META_DIRS and the file entry is gone.

The cleaner principle:

1. **Directory convention when possible.** If every file under a directory shares the same routing,
   put the directory name in META_DIRS / SKIP_WALK_DIRS, not each file.
2. **Explicit list when root-level meaning is ambiguous.** Root files (`README.md`, `VERSION`,
   `.gitignore`, `REPO_TYPE`) need per-repo customization; list them in META_FILES.
3. **Override table only for true routing exceptions.** Currently the only exception encoded in
   `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` is `exclude_repos` (blocks a universal file from shipping back to its
   source repo). Language gates, `requires_repo_file` gates, and `bucket` fields have been removed.

Do not try to eliminate all hardcoding. Root has mixed semantics; explicit lists are correct there.

## Folder convention

| Want to ... | Put the file under | Ships to |
|---|---|---|
| Doc that every repo gets | docs/ | every repo, overwrite |
| Universal test or helper | tests/ (any non-meta file) | every repo, overwrite |
| Helper script in devel/ | devel/ | every repo, overwrite |
| Starter file that must not clobber existing | templates/<type>/noexist/<consumer-path> | only when missing |
| TypeScript-only file (any subpath, including tools/) | templates/typescript/<consumer-path> | typescript repos only |
| Web-general file (playwright style, web docs) | templates/website/<consumer-path> | the website family: website repos plus inheriting types (typescript) |
| Rust-only file (any subpath, including tools/) | templates/rust/<consumer-path> | rust repos only |
| Conditionally-shipped overlay (e.g. PyPI tools) | templates/<type>/_overlay/<consumer-path> + conditional_overlays rule | selected repos only (see below) |
| One canonical file shared by a SET of types | templates/shared/<consumer-path> + shared_overlays rule | the rule's repo_types (see below) |
| Root-level file like AGENTS.md | template root + add to ROOT_PROPAGATE_ALLOWLIST | every repo, overwrite |
| Universal gitignore blocks | templates/gitignore.universal | every repo, merged into .gitignore under `# === UNIVERSAL ===` |
| MERGE bucket (set-union @-import merge with strip list) | template root + add to `MERGE_FILES` | every repo; template @-imports union-added to consumer; strip list at `meta/propagation/deprecated_claude_md.txt` removes retired entries (see [MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md](MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md)) |
| Template-only tooling at ROOT | tools/<file> (repo-root tools/, e.g. tools/detect_repo_type.py) | never (template-meta); removed at reset |
| Typed-overlay tooling | templates/<type>/tools/<file> (e.g. templates/typescript/tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py) | that type only, ships at consumer tools/<file> |

**Standard: every file under `templates/<type>/` ships** to consumers of that
type, at its path relative to `templates/<type>/`. This includes `tools/`
subpaths. The typed-overlay walker no longer filters subdirectories against
META_DIRS; only the META_FILES basename guard still applies (so a stray
`templates/<type>/README.md` cannot clobber a consumer README). The ROOT `tools/`
directory is separate: it holds template infrastructure (e.g.
`tools/detect_repo_type.py`), never ships, and is removed during reset.

**Underscore folders (`_folder`) are conditional overlays.** Any folder whose
name starts with `_` under `templates/<type>/` (e.g. `templates/python/_pypi/`)
is a conditional overlay. The base typed-overlay walk skips it. A matching rule
in `conditional_overlays` in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` enables it per
consumer. Conditional overlay shape:

```yaml
conditional_overlays:
  python:
    _pypi:
      when: has_file
      path: pyproject.toml
      description: >-
        PyPI packaging overlay: ships submit_to_pypi.py and a pyproject.toml
        seed only to python repos that are packaged for PyPI.
```

The only supported `when` verb is `has_file`. The overlay ships when the named
`path` exists at the consumer repo root. Files inside the overlay are routed
using the same noexist/overwrite rules as other typed overlay files.

## Repo type inheritance

Repo types form a single-token inheritance DAG declared in the
`repo_type_inherits` manifest (`meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`): `python ->
scripted`, `rust -> compiled`, `swift -> compiled`, `typescript -> website`.
`scripted`, `website`, `compiled`, and `other` are roots with no parent; every
token (including the roots) is a directly usable `REPO_TYPE` marker.

`repolib.model.effective_type_chain(repo_type)` returns `[repo_type,
*ancestors]` nearest-first and is the one expansion every routing path
consumes:

- **Typed overlays**: a consumer receives its own `templates/<type>/` overlay
  PLUS every ancestor's overlay, unioned. A `typescript` repo ships
  `templates/typescript/` and `templates/website/` content; a `website` repo
  ships only `templates/website/`. Ancestor conditional overlays
  (`templates/<ancestor>/_<name>/`) are inherited the same way.
- **Shared overlays**: a rule's `repo_types` list matches when it intersects
  the consumer's chain, so naming a base type reaches every descendant.
- **Disjointness invariant**: a type and its ancestors never ship the same
  consumer path, so overlay order cannot affect results
  (`tests/meta/test_repo_type_inheritance.py` guards this).

The loader (`repolib.manifests.build_repo_type_inherits`) validates at import
time that every parent is a known token and the graph is acyclic. A base with
no `templates/<base>/` directory contributes universal files alone, so adding
a future type under an existing base needs only a manifest entry.

## Shared overlays (templates/shared/)

A conditional overlay routes to ONE repo type; a shared overlay routes ONE
canonical file to a chosen SET of repo types. Drop the file under
`templates/shared/<consumer-path>` and name it in a `shared_overlays` rule in
`meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`. Shared-overlay shape:

```yaml
shared_overlays:
  source_release:
    paths:
      - devel/make_release.py
    repo_types:
      - scripted
      - compiled
      - other
```

The live `source_release` rule ships `make_release.py` to the scripted and
compiled families plus `other`. `repo_types` entries match against the
consumer's full inheritance chain (see [Repo type inheritance](#repo-type-inheritance)),
so naming a base type reaches every descendant: `python` receives the file by
inheriting `scripted`, and `rust`/`swift` by inheriting `compiled`. The website
family (`website`, `typescript`) stays outside the rule because a docs or game
site publishes builds, not GitHub source releases. The optional
`noexist/`-prefixed paths and `when: lacks_file` features documented below are
still supported by the mechanism; this rule simply does not use them.

- `paths` -- template-relative paths under `templates/shared/` the rule ships. A bare path
  (e.g. `devel/make_release.py`) lands in the overwrite bucket and always overwrites the
  consumer copy. A `noexist/` prefix (e.g. `noexist/docs/RELEASE_HISTORY.md`) strips the
  prefix and routes the file to the noexist-only bucket, so it is written only if the
  consumer does not already have that file. Use `noexist/` for seed files (stubs, empty
  scaffolds, initial history files) that should never clobber accumulated consumer content.
- `repo_types` -- consumer `REPO_TYPE` tokens that receive the paths.
- `when` -- optional condition verb. The only supported verb is `lacks_file`
  (the mirror of the conditional-overlay `has_file`): the rule ships only when
  `path` is ABSENT at the consumer root. Omit `when` to ship unconditionally to
  every listed repo type. An unknown verb raises with a clear message.
- `path` -- marker file path (relative to the consumer root) the verb tests.

Files inside `templates/shared/` route by subdirectory exactly like a typed
overlay: `devel/<x>` -> devel, `tests/<x>` -> tests, `noexist/<x>` ->
noexist-only, everything else -> overwrite at its relative path. Every file under
`templates/shared/` must be named by at least one rule's `paths`; the shared walk
raises on an uncovered file so a shared file never routes nowhere. An empty or
absent `templates/shared/` tree is a no-op.

The `lacks_file: pyproject.toml` example reuses this template's PyPI marker
convention (`pyproject.toml` present means a PyPI python repo). It is a template
convention here, not a Python-ecosystem rule; a non-PyPI python repo that keeps a
`pyproject.toml` for tooling would be treated as PyPI by this rule.

## Precedence

File routing honors a strict precedence order; earlier rules win on conflict:

1. **META_FILES / META_DIRS** - Files in these block-lists never ship to any consumer, even if matched by other rules.
2. **MERGE_FILES** - Files in this set route to the `merge_files` bucket regardless of where the walker would otherwise place them. Post-walker step 6 in `compute_propagation_plan` moves matching entries out of `overwrite_files` / `noexist_files` into `merge_files`. See [MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md](MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md).
3. **ROUTING_OVERRIDES** - Per-file exceptions. Currently the only supported field is `exclude_repos` (blocks a file from shipping to its source repo). Language and requires_repo_file gates have been removed; use location-based routing or conditional overlays instead.
4. **UNIVERSAL_NOEXIST** - Files in this list override the universal overwrite default; they move to noexist_files instead.
5. **Typed noexist** - Templates/<type>/noexist/<path> overrides typed overlay overwrite; same path in noexist always wins.
6. **Typed overlay shadows universal** - When both universal and typed overlay define the same consumer destination, the typed version ships. The propagator prints `[OVERLAY-OVERRIDE] <consumer-path>: typed overlay shadows universal source` to stdout for visibility.

## Classification criterion

Every file the propagator ships is classified into one of four policy categories. The classification rule for new files:

- **OVERWRITE** -- template centrally owns the file; consumer divergence is a bug to erase on next sync. Use for style guides, shared lint tests, shared helper scripts, and the universal clean sweep.
- **MERGE** -- template ships an `@`-import set; the propagator union-adds it to the consumer file and strips entries listed in `meta/propagation/deprecated_claude_md.txt`. Consumer-local `@`-imports and non-`@` content are preserved. Currently used by `CLAUDE.md` only. See [MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md](MERGE_BUCKET_SPEC.md).
- **NOEXIST** -- starter seed; consumer owns the file thereafter. Use when the consumer reasonably extends the file with project-specific content the template cannot anticipate (e.g., `AGENTS.md`, `source_me.sh`, `tsconfig.json`, deploy scripts).
- **META** -- never ships, any bucket, any repo type. Use for template-only infrastructure (propagator itself, reset_repo, README, VERSION) and per-repo content the template cannot author (CHANGELOG, .gitignore, REPO_TYPE).

## Exceptions in the manifest

Most additions are drop-and-go. All manifests live in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`
(single source of truth). `repolib/manifests.py:load_manifests()` reads the YAML at import time;
`repolib/model.py` assigns the loaded values to its module-level public names. Do not add inline
manifest literals back to `repolib/model.py`.

- `ROOT_PROPAGATE_ALLOWLIST` -- root files that DO ship. Default: CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, source_me.sh,
  dist_clean.sh, pip_requirements-dev.txt. Add here when introducing a new root-level file all repos need.
- `UNIVERSAL_NOEXIST` -- universal files that ship only when missing at consumer. Default: AGENTS.md,
  source_me.sh, docs/AUTHORS.md, tests/TESTS_README.md, pip_requirements-dev.txt.

The two sets compose: `ROOT_PROPAGATE_ALLOWLIST` decides IF a root file ships; `UNIVERSAL_NOEXIST`
then decides HOW (overwrite vs noexist-only). Overlap is intentional: `AGENTS.md` and `source_me.sh`
appear in both - allowlisted to ship, then routed noexist-only so they don't clobber consumer
customizations. `CLAUDE.md` is allowlisted and routed via `MERGE_FILES` (set-union of `@`-imports plus
deprecation-strip list); consumer keeps any local `@`-imports and non-`@` content.
- `MERGE_FILES` -- files routed to the MERGE bucket. Default: CLAUDE.md. Template `@`-imports are
  union-added to the consumer file; any consumer line matching `meta/propagation/deprecated_claude_md.txt`
  is stripped.
- `meta/propagation/deprecated_claude_md.txt` -- user-editable strip manifest for the CLAUDE.md
  set-union merge. Lines in this file are removed from every consumer CLAUDE.md on every sync (after
  comment/blank-line filtering). Add a line when retiring an `@`-import from the template.
- `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` -- per-file exceptions. Currently holds only one entry:
  `docs/CLAUDE_HOOK_USAGE_GUIDE.md: {exclude_repos: [claude-code-permissions-hook]}` (blocks the
  mirror from shipping back to its source repo). Language gates, `requires_repo_file` gates, and
  `bucket` fields have been removed; use location or `conditional_overlays` instead. `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md`
  and `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` now route by location (universal doc and `_pypi` overlay respectively).
- `conditional_overlays` -- per-type underscore-folder rules. See the `_folder` section above.
- `shared_overlays` -- named rules routing `templates/shared/` files to a SET of repo types, with
  an optional `lacks_file` condition. See the shared-overlays section above.
- `META_FILES` / `META_DIRS` / `META_TEST_PREFIXES` -- block-lists for files that NEVER ship
  (propagator itself, reset_repo, LICENSES/, etc.).

## Examples

- Adding `docs/SHELL_STYLE.md` -- drop in `docs/`, no manifest edit. Every repo gets it.
- Adding `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` -- already universal; drop in `docs/`. Every repo type gets it.
- Adding `tests/test_security_audit.py` -- drop in `tests/`, every repo gets it. The `tests/` walk is a denylist: it ships every non-meta `tests/` file by location and skips only dotfiles, `_`-prefixed scratch, `conftest.py` (owned by `merge_conftest`), and `META_TEST_PREFIXES`. A non-`test_`-prefixed helper like `tests/helper_thing.py` ships too.
- Adding `templates/typescript/.eslintignore` -- drop under `templates/typescript/`. TypeScript repos get it at consumer root.
- Adding a new starter `Makefile` that must not clobber existing ones -- drop at `templates/<type>/noexist/Makefile` (per type) or add path to `UNIVERSAL_NOEXIST` + place at template root.
- Adding a python-only tool needed only when `pyproject.toml` exists -- place under `templates/python/_pypi/<consumer-path>` and add a `conditional_overlays.python._pypi` rule (already defined). Example: `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` lives at `templates/python/_pypi/devel/submit_to_pypi.py`.
- Adding an `exclude_repos` exception -- add to `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` with `exclude_repos: [<repo-basename>]`. Use only to prevent a mirror file from shipping back to its source repo.

## conftest.py managed blocks

`tests/conftest.py` is excluded from the standard `tests/` walker and handled by
`repolib.files.merge_conftest` (called from `repolib.process`). The function ships
three named blocks additively into the consumer file.

| Block | Detection token | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| collect_ignore | `collect_ignore` | Excludes `e2e`, `playwright`, and `meta/e2e` subtrees from pytest collection. |
| REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS | `REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS` | Repo-local hygiene-exclusion registry read by `file_utils.discover_files`. Template value is an empty dict; consumers extend it with project-specific glob patterns. |
| OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU | `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU` | Commented-out recipe menu appended once. Ships two recipes: sys.path repo-root insert and MPLCONFIGDIR redirect. |

**Append-if-missing, never-overwrite contract:** for each block, `merge_conftest`
checks whether the detection token is already present in the consumer file. A missing
block is appended in canonical order (collect_ignore, then REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS, then
OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU). An existing or edited block is never touched. Consumer
additions between blocks or after the menu are preserved verbatim.

**Why hygiene fixtures are excluded from the template:** the canonical hygiene tests
(`test_ascii_compliance.py`, `test_whitespace.py`) read
`pytestconfig.getoption("no_ascii_fix", default=False)` directly via pytest's built-in
config access. The older `skip_repo_hygiene`, `ascii_fix_enabled`, and
`pytest_addoption("--no-ascii-fix")` fixtures are stale leftovers from a previous
design. They are intentionally absent from the template conftest so that propagation
does not reintroduce them into consumer repos.

## Routing override gates

The `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` dict in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` now holds only `exclude_repos`
exceptions. Language gates, `requires_repo_file` gates, and `bucket` fields have been removed.

- **`exclude_repos` gate** - Blocks a file from shipping when the destination repo basename matches
  any entry in the list. Use only for mirror files that must not overwrite the source repo.
  Example: `docs/CLAUDE_HOOK_USAGE_GUIDE.md` is sourced from `claude-code-permissions-hook`; the
  `exclude_repos` rule prevents the mirror from shipping back to that repo.

For all other routing needs, use location-based conventions (folder placement, `noexist/`,
typed overlay, or `_folder` conditional overlay).

## What never propagates

Listed in `META_FILES` / `META_DIRS` / `META_TEST_PREFIXES`. Includes the propagator entry script `propagate_style_guides.py`, reset_repo.py, README.md, VERSION, .gitignore, REPO_TYPE, pip_extras.txt, pip_requirements-meta.txt (root META_FILES; the latter is also git-rm'd from consumer clones by reset_repo.py); `repolib/` helper package, ROOT `tools/` (detect_repo_type.py and other root-level template infrastructure; note that `templates/<type>/tools/` is a separate path that DOES ship), `meta/` (this doc and other template-meta), `templates/` (every file under `templates/<type>/` ships at its relative path, including tools/ subpaths; `templates/shared/` files ship to the repo types named by their `shared_overlays` rule), `LICENSES/`, `docs/active_plans/`, `docs/archive/`, `experiment_reports/`, `__pycache__/`, `.git/` (META_DIRS). Tests are excluded via two mechanisms: `tests/meta/` is excluded as a whole via `SKIP_WALK_DIRS` containing `'meta'`, and tests starting with `test_repolib_`, `test_reset_repo_`, or `test_detect_repo_type` are also excluded via `META_TEST_PREFIXES`.

## Link bucket isolation

A file may only link to targets that propagate with it. The rule prevents universal docs from hardcoding links to template-specific overlays, which would silently break when those overlays do not ship to a given repo type.

Allowed link transitions:

- `universal` -> `universal` only. Universal files (docs, tests, devel scripts) link only to other universal targets that ship to every repo type.
- `overlay-<type>` -> `universal` or `overlay-<type>` (same type). TypeScript-specific docs may link to universal docs or other TypeScript overlay docs, but not to Rust overlays or other types.
- `meta` -> any bucket in the template. Meta files (template-only tooling and documentation) never ship to consumers, so they may link anywhere.

Enforcement: [../../tests/meta/test_link_bucket_isolation.py](../../tests/meta/test_link_bucket_isolation.py) walks all tracked `*.md` files, classifies each file's bucket, resolves local links, and hard-fails on disallowed transitions.
