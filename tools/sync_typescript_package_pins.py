"""Bump every package.json dependency and devDependency under the CWD
to ``>=<current-latest>`` from the npm registry.

Scope: both the ``dependencies`` and ``devDependencies`` sections of
each ``package.json`` are bumped. This tool rewrites ``package.json``
only. It never edits ``package-lock.json`` or ``node_modules`` (npm
owns lockfile resolution); after an apply run it prints the npm
commands to regenerate the lockfile and audit for known flaws.

Discovery: recursive walk from the current working directory; every
``package.json`` is in scope. No filtering by signature file, by repo
type, by name, or by path. Skipped only: ``node_modules``, ``.git``,
``dist``, ``build``, ``__pycache__``, ``.venv``, ``venv``,
``.pytest_cache``, ``.mypy_cache``, and dotfile dirs (walk efficiency,
not project filtering).

Anchor: CWD. Run from ``~/nsh`` to sweep every sibling repo; run from
a single repo to scope to that tree; run from anywhere to scope to that
anywhere.

Source of truth for versions: ``npm view <pkg> version`` per package.
Pin shape: ``>={latest}`` uniformly (the user does not support versions
older than today; ``>=`` avoids the npm 0.x caret quirk that would lock
``^0.25.0`` below the current 0.28.x line).

This script ships to typescript consumer repos at
``tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py`` in each consumer (every file
under ``templates/typescript/`` ships at its relative path). The anchor
is the CWD, not the script location, so run from ``~/nsh`` to sweep all
repos or from a single repo to scope to that tree.

Run:

    python3 tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py [--dry-run]

Default mode prints the per-target diff and writes the changes back.
``--dry-run`` (alias ``-n``) prints the diff and writes nothing.
