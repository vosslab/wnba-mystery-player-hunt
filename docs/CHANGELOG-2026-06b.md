## 2026-06-29

### Additions and New Features

- `templates/shared/` routing primitive (WP-ENG1): added `shared_overlays` manifest
  section in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`. Each rule names `paths`, `repo_types`,
  and an optional `lacks_file` presence condition that ships only when a marker file is
  absent at the consumer. The shared walk raises on any `templates/shared/` file not
  covered by a rule; universal and typed walks are unchanged.

- `templates/shared/devel/make_release.py` (WP-A1/A2): new maintainer script that
  prepares a GitHub source release. Checks CalVer freshness and a free version tag;
  verifies a committed LICENSE is present; builds zip and tgz archives with
  byte-level LICENSE spot-checks; generates an LLM prompt for the release
  description using changelog range or initial-release fallback; and prints the
  final `git tag` and `gh release create` commands. Under `--write`, calls
  `prepend_release_history` and `prepend_news` to insert a `## v{version} - YYYY-MM-DD`
  block at the top of `docs/RELEASE_HISTORY.md` and `docs/NEWS.md` respectively,
  preserving all older content and raising on duplicate-version headings. Dry-run
  prints the would-be headings and file paths without touching disk.
  `pyflakes` clean; `pytest tests/` 1289 passed.

- `docs/RELEASE_HISTORY.md` and `docs/NEWS.md` noexist seeds (WP-C1/RR): routed
  scaffold stubs for both doc files through the `source_release` shared rule so
  consumer repos without those files receive them on first propagation. Seeds carry
  a placeholder heading; writers in `make_release.py` prepend above it on first use.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `source_release` rule registered in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` (WP-REG1/RR):
  routes `devel/make_release.py` (overwrite bucket) plus noexist seeds
  `docs/RELEASE_HISTORY.md` and `docs/NEWS.md` to rust, swift, other, and non-PyPI
  python repos via a `lacks_file: pyproject.toml` condition. Excluded for PyPI python
  (has `pyproject.toml`) and typescript. Release docs ship as noexist seeds so reset
  and propagation never clobber accumulated history; `make_release.py` stays in the
  overwrite bucket so consumers always receive the current helper.

- `find_source_for_bucket` (WP-REG1): extended the propagation engine to resolve
  `source_release` shared overlay paths at routing time so the rule is exercised by
  the existing manifest/disk sync tests without special-casing.

- `output_release/` added to `.gitignore` overlay so archive output directories
  created by `make_release.py` are excluded from consumer repo history by default.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `reset_repo.py`: (superseded within this same session by the full gate removal
  in the next bullet; recorded here for the design trail) fixed
  `verify_license_copy` so `./reset_repo.py` no longer
  aborts with `License copy verification failed` for non-MIT licenses. The old
  check read the first 100 chars of the copied license and passed only if the
  SPDX id (`GPL-3.0`, or normalized `GPL 3.0`) appeared in the body. Real license
  texts never contain their SPDX id: GPL/AGPL/LGPL begin `GNU ... GENERAL PUBLIC
  LICENSE`, Apache-2.0 begins `Apache License / Version 2.0`, MPL-2.0 begins
  `Mozilla Public License Version 2.0`; only MIT (`MIT License`) happened to
  match, so every other choice failed the gate. Replaced the SPDX-substring
  heuristic with a faithful-copy check: target exists, is non-empty, and its
  text equals the source content (now passed into `verify_license_copy`). This is
  fix-the-design-not-the-symptom: the verifier confirms the copy reproduced the
  source rather than guessing at body text. Verified all six bundled licenses
  (MIT, Apache-2.0, LGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, MPL-2.0) now pass.

- `reset_repo.py`: removed the `verify_license_copy` gate entirely rather than
  keep a corrected-but-tautological check. After the fix it only re-read the
  exact bytes just written and compared them to the in-memory source; a real read
  or write failure already raises on its own, and `preflight_check` already
  guarantees the source exists, so the gate could never catch a true failure and
  its only history was false aborts. This also enforces a design rule for reset:
  the only input-dependent validation that ran AFTER mutations had begun
  (`write_marker` and the license copy were already done) is gone, so a normal
  reset no longer fails mid-run on a valid license choice. `copy_and_verify_license`
  is now `copy_license` (dropped the `spdx_id` param, the verify branch, and the
  rollback message); both opens keep `encoding="utf-8"`. The remaining
  post-mutation checks (`verify_scaffold_sentinel`, `verify_clean_end_state`) fire
  only on an internal tool regression, never on valid user input.

- `tests/meta/test_reset_repo_self_propagation.py`: removed
  `test_process_repo_result_has_name_and_type`, a fragile required-key-list test
  (`assert "name" in result`) that duplicated the meaningful
  `assert result is not None` already covered by
  `test_process_repo_returns_dict_not_none`. See `docs/PYTEST_STYLE.md`.

- `tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py`: rewrote the `other` case comment that
  documented the old SPDX-substring bug as a permanent MIT-only constraint. The
  case still uses MIT because this e2e clones COMMITTED history and runs the
  committed `reset_repo.py`; once the gate removal is committed the case can
  switch to a non-MIT license (e.g. `g`) to exercise a GNU-style body through the
  copy step. Verified `pytest tests/meta/` 282 passed and the reset-routing e2e
  passes all cases.

- `tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py`: now that the gate removal is committed,
  switched the `other` case from MIT to GPL-3.0 so the e2e exercises the license
  copy on a GNU-style body (whose text never contains its SPDX id) -- real
  regression coverage against any return of the old substring gate. Verified the
  full suite: `pytest tests/` 1200 passed; `tests/meta/e2e/run_all.sh` 1 passed,
  0 failed, with `LICENSE.GPL-3.0.md` installed in the `other` clone.

- `tests/meta/test_reset_repo_all_licenses_equal.py`: new fast parametrized test
  asserting all licenses are treated equally. For every selectable license
  (`CODE_LICENSES` plus the non-`none` `DOCS_LICENSES`), it pins two invariants:
  the menu choice ships a `LICENSES/LICENSE.<spdx>.md` source file, and
  `copy_license` reproduces that body byte-for-byte. Covers all eight installable
  licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, LGPL-3.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, MPL-2.0, CC-BY-4.0,
  CC-BY-SA-4.0) so no license is privileged and none can ship without a backing
  file. `pytest tests/` 1216 passed.

- `reset_repo.py`: made `git_rm` and `git_rm_recursive` idempotent so a reset can
  never abort mid-run on a path that is simply already gone. `git rm` on an
  untracked pathspec exits 128, which raised `CalledProcessError` and aborted the
  reset; five call sites (`LICENSES/`, `propagate_style_guides.py`, `repolib/`,
  `pip_requirements-meta.txt`, `reset_repo.py`) were unguarded, so a re-run on a
  partially reset repo could fail partway. Both helpers now consult a new
  `path_has_tracked_entry` helper (a read-only `git ls-files -- <path>` check)
  and skip with a message, returning 0 instead of removing, when nothing is
  tracked. The pre-existing inline `templates/` and `tools/` guards are left in
  place (they also report a directory left on disk). This extends the
  "never fail mid reset" rule from input-dependent gates to the cleanup phase.
  Verified idempotency against a real temp git repo (tracked path removes once;
  re-remove and never-tracked paths skip cleanly with no exit-128); `pytest
  tests/` 1216 passed and the reset-routing e2e passes all cases.

### Developer Tests and Notes

- `tests/meta/test_shared_overlays.py` (WP-ENG2/REG1): added regression tests for
  the shared-overlay routing primitive. Covers `shared_rule_ships_to` (ship/skip by
  repo_types, unconditional rules, `lacks_file` condition, unknown-verb raises, and
  the "unlisted type never reaches verb check" residual risk), `shared_path_ships`
  (any-matching-rule ships; monkeypatched for isolation), `all_shared_overlay_paths`
  (union of all rule paths), two-way manifest/disk sync (manifest-to-disk parametrize
  produces zero cases while `shared_overlays: {}` and auto-populates as rules are
  added; disk-to-manifest direction uses a tmp_path tree to confirm the coverage
  guard raises on an uncovered file). 14 passed, 1 skipped; suite green after
  source_release rule registration (pre-existing failures resolved).

- `tests/meta/test_make_release.py` (WP-D1a): 27 unit tests for
  `templates/shared/devel/make_release.py`. Imports the canonical copy via
  `importlib.util.spec_from_file_location`. Covers CalVer freshness raises and
  pass, tag-free check (raises on existing tag), committed-LICENSE check (raises
  when missing), archive byte-match for zip and tgz (pass and raise), LLM prompt
  (version in output, initial-release fallback, prior-tag path), both doc writers
  (round-trip preserving older entries; duplicate-version raises), command builders
  (`build_tag_command`, `build_gh_release_command`, `build_archive_arg_lists`),
  HEAD snapshot build in a temp git repo with a committed fixture LICENSE, and
  observability (dry-run and --write leave `git tag --list` unchanged; tag and gh
  commands surface in printed output). All 27 passed.

- `tests/meta/e2e/e2e_make_release.py` (WP-D1b): end-to-end release flow test.
  Clones the repo into a tmp git tree, runs `make_release.py` in dry-run and
  `--write` modes, verifies archive contents and byte-check, confirms doc prepend
  behavior, and checks that printed output contains the `git tag` and
  `gh release create` commands. Exits non-zero on any failure.

- `tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py` (WP-REG1): extended the routing e2e to
  assert `source_release` shared overlay files propagate correctly to non-Python
  consumer repo clones and are absent from Python consumer clones that have
  `pyproject.toml`.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `repolib/files.py`: fixed misleading comment on `file_rel` assignment in the
  shared-overlay walk (block 2b). The old comment said "i.e. the consumer path"
  which is wrong for noexist entries whose `noexist/` prefix is stripped below.
  Comment now reads: "file_rel is the path relative to templates/shared/ (a
  leading noexist/ prefix is stripped below to yield the consumer path)."

- `templates/shared/devel/make_release.py`: added return code guard to
  `ensure_tag_free` before inspecting stdout. After
  `result = changelog_lib.run_git(["tag", "--list", tag_name])`, added a check
  that raises `RuntimeError` naming the failure and including `result.stderr.strip()`
  when `result.returncode != 0`. Matches the guard shape in `ensure_committed_license`.
  Verified `pytest tests/meta/test_make_release.py` 23 passed and
  `e2e_make_release.py` EXIT=0.

- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: corrected stale Developer Tests note in the
  `test_shared_overlays.py` entry. Removed pre-registration wording
  ("pre-existing 11 failures...pending WP-REG1") and updated to reflect the
  final green state after source_release rule registration.

## 2026-06-27

### Additions and New Features

- `docs/PYTEST_STYLE.md`: added a rule that pytests should use inline,
  self-contained inputs rather than external on-disk data files. A test that
  reads an external file is fragile by design: the file can move or be deleted,
  and an import-time load takes the whole module down when it vanishes. Added a
  checklist item and an "Inline inputs, not external data files" subsection that
  distinguishes external data files (the hazard) from pytest fixtures and
  `tmp_path` (fine), and routes genuinely large round trips to `tests/e2e/`.

- `templates/typescript/eslint.config.js`: promoted three customizations into the
  canonical TypeScript ESLint config (propagated to all TypeScript consumers).
  (1) A browser-globals block scoped to `tests/playwright/**` and `tests/e2e/**`
  so `page.evaluate` callbacks referencing `window`/`document` do not trip
  `no-undef`, while node-only tools keep `no-undef` (no glob widening). (2) A
  repo-wide `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` ignore for underscore-prefixed
  identifiers (`argsIgnorePattern`/`varsIgnorePattern`/`caughtErrorsIgnorePattern`
  `^_`) as a deliberate, visible opt-out marker. (3) `OTHER_REPOS/**` added to
  `ignores`, matching the repo-wide gitignore for the sibling-repo checkout dir.

- `templates/typescript/noexist/eslint.config.local.js`: new consumer-owned ESLint
  extension hook. Ships once via the noexist bucket (never overwritten by
  propagation). The canonical `eslint.config.js` imports and spreads it last, so
  repo-specific overrides (e.g. browser globals for named tool `.mjs` files)
  survive propagation instead of being clobbered when `eslint.config.js` is
  overwritten. Default export is an empty array. Documented the config ownership,
  the browser-globals scope, the `^_` ignore, and the `OTHER_REPOS/**` ignore in
  `templates/typescript/docs/TYPESCRIPT_STYLE.md`.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `templates/typescript/docs/TYPESCRIPT_STYLE.md`: reframed the build-system
  docs so the four shell scripts (`./check_codebase.sh`,
  `./build_github_pages.sh`, `./run_web_server.sh`, `./dist_clean.sh`) read as
  the front door for all users, with `npm run` aliases documented as optional
  1:1 mirrors. Added a shell-script-to-npm-alias mapping table (evidence-based
  from `templates/typescript/noexist/package.json`), direct-command equivalents
  for the npm-only aliases (`npx prettier --write`, `npx playwright test`, the
  `./devel/setup_*.sh` scripts), and a future-facing "shell versus Python" rule
  (shell for simple orchestration, named Python scripts for complex logic). The
  runnable interface is unchanged; only the framing was clarified. Added a "two
  audiences, one interface" principle and explicit alias rules: shell scripts are
  the canonical interface, npm aliases are allowed only when they mirror a shell
  script or shorten a verbose tool command (`format:write`), weak aliases are
  removed, and the mirror set stays small rather than gutted (TypeScript repos
  still expect some `package.json` scripts).

- Front-door script headers (`templates/typescript/check_codebase.sh`,
  `templates/typescript/noexist/build_github_pages.sh`,
  `templates/typescript/run_web_server.sh`, `devel/dist_clean.sh`): added a
  comment block stating each script is run directly as `./<script>.sh` with the
  matching `npm run` alias as an optional mirror. `dist_clean.sh` notes the
  `npm run clean` alias applies in TypeScript repos only. Comments only; no
  logic, step order, or flags changed. Verified with
  `bash templates/typescript/check_codebase.sh --help` (exits 0).

- Relocated `templates/typescript/devel/html_to_pdf.mjs` back to
  `templates/typescript/tools/html_to_pdf.mjs` via `git mv`. It is a
  consumer-facing tool, not a maintainer-only `devel/` script (see
  `devel/DEVEL_README.md`). The typed-overlay walk ships `templates/<type>/tools/`
  to consumers verbatim (`repolib/files.py` un-skips `tools` from the typed
  overlay at line 1039 and routes subdir files to the overwrite bucket), so the
  file now ships to each TypeScript consumer at `tools/html_to_pdf.mjs` with no
  manifest change. The earlier devel relocation is reverted. The file header and
  `templates/typescript/docs/PLAYWRIGHT_USAGE.md` already use the `tools/` path,
  so they are correct again.

### Removals and Deprecations

- Removed the `pdf` script from `templates/typescript/noexist/package.json`
  (`"pdf": "node tools/html_to_pdf.mjs"`). The tool is run directly as
  `node tools/html_to_pdf.mjs`; no npm alias is shipped. Updated
  `templates/typescript/docs/PLAYWRIGHT_USAGE.md` to drop the `npm run pdf`
  example and the `npm pkg set scripts.pdf=...` setup step, and removed the
  `npm run pdf` row from the `TYPESCRIPT_STYLE.md` npm-only alias table (the tool
  is now noted as run directly). No test referenced the `pdf` script.

## 2026-06-25

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `templates/typescript/noexist/deploy-pages.yml`: bumped `actions/checkout@v6`
  to `@v7`, added `cache: npm` to the `setup-node` step, and added an
  `actions/configure-pages@v6` step before the artifact upload, matching the
  newer workflow in `concept-map-maker`. Local build step (`npm install` +
  `./build_github_pages.sh`) and `upload-pages-artifact@v5` / `deploy-pages@v5`
  versions are unchanged.

## 2026-06-21

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `tests/conftest.py`: now imports `file_utils` at module load and inserts the
  repo root onto `sys.path` by default via `file_utils.get_repo_root()`
  (`_repo_root = file_utils.get_repo_root()`; `sys.path.insert(0, _repo_root)`
  when not already present). This activates the behavior that was previously only
  the commented-out `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU` Recipe 1, using the preferred
  `file_utils` helper rather than an inline `subprocess` call. Verified with
  `pytest tests/ --co` (1199 tests collected, no import error).

- `tests/conftest.py` `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU`: removed the sys.path repo-root
  insert recipe (was Recipe 1) since that behavior is now active by default at
  the top of the file. Replaced it with a one-line note pointing to the active
  block, and renumbered the matplotlib `MPLCONFIGDIR` recipe to Recipe 1. This
  removes the confusing dead recipe new managers saw alongside the now-active
  code.

### Removals and Deprecations

- `meta/propagation/deprecated_tests.txt`: added `test_import_rules.py` and
  `test_pyright_code_lint.py`. Both are now git-rm'd from each consumer's `tests/`
  on the next propagation run (via `remove_deprecated_tests` in `repolib/process.py`).
  These two test scripts were dropped after a decision not to keep them.

## 2026-06-17

### Additions and New Features

- `templates/gitignore.universal` and root `.gitignore`: ignore `OTHER_REPOS/`, the
  sibling-repo checkout directory used for local cross-repo work. The universal entry
  propagates to every consumer; the root entry lives in the template-only `LOCAL` section.

- `Brewfile` now ships to consumers as a starter (moved from `meta_files` to
  `root_propagate_allowlist` + `universal_noexist` in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`;
  was previously template-only and never shipped). The universal root `Brewfile` is a
  header-only starter; `templates/python/noexist/Brewfile` adds `brew "python@3.12"` and
  shadows the universal version for `REPO_TYPE=python` repos. Non-python types receive the
  universal starter.

- `tests/conftest.py` (canonical template): added a third managed block,
  `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU` (token `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU`, header `# === OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU ===`).
  Ships two commented-out recipes: (1) sys.path repo-root insert via
  `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`; (2) MPLCONFIGDIR redirect to a per-repo tmp location.
  The block is all-comments by default so an untouched consumer behaves identically to
  before propagation added it. `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md` documents all three
  managed blocks and the append-if-missing/never-overwrite contract.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `repolib.files.merge_conftest`: extended from two managed blocks to three. Now splits the
  canonical `tests/conftest.py` on up to three detection tokens (`collect_ignore`,
  `REPO_HYGIENE_FILTERS`, `OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU`) and appends any missing block in
  canonical order. Existing or edited blocks in the consumer are never overwritten.
  Graceful degradation preserved: source files missing marker 3 behave identically to the
  previous two-block implementation.

- `repolib/model.py` `find_source_for_bucket`: the `noexist_files` source lookup now checks
  typed/overlay roots (`templates/<type>/noexist/<path>`) BEFORE the universal root, matching
  the existing typed-first precedence of `overwrite_files` and `devel_files` (precedence rule
  5: repo-specific wins over universal). Previously noexist resolved the universal root first,
  so a typed overlay could never shadow a same-named universal file. Only `Brewfile` currently
  exists at both locations, so this is the sole behavior change; overlay-only files
  (`pip_requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`) and root-only files (`AGENTS.md`, `source_me.sh`,
  `pip_requirements-dev.txt`) resolve unchanged. Reset applies the typed source because it runs
  with `initial_setup=True`, which copies noexist files over the cloned destination.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `tests/conftest.py`: added cross-link comment `# See meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md for
  the managed-block propagation contract.` immediately after the `# === OPTIONAL_HELPERS_MENU ===`
  header line so readers know where the contract is documented.

- `docs/E2E_TESTS.md`: updated all three stale `collect_ignore = ["e2e", "playwright"]`
  literals (lines 12, 31, 40) to `collect_ignore = ["e2e", "playwright", "meta/e2e"]`
  to match the shipped template and the `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md` table.

- `reset_repo.py`: now removes `pip_requirements-meta.txt` during the git rm cleanup phase.
  The file holds deps for the template's own meta tooling (propagate/reset/tests), is a
  `meta_files` entry (never ships), and previously lingered in consumer clones after reset.

- `tests/meta/test_repolib_helpers.py`: added `TestFindSourceNoexistPrecedence` covering the
  typed-first noexist resolution (python -> overlay Brewfile, rust -> universal root Brewfile,
  root-only files unaffected).

- `docs/PYTEST_STYLE.md`, `tests/TESTS_README.md`, `templates/typescript/docs/PLAYWRIGHT_USAGE.md`:
  synced all stale `collect_ignore = ["e2e", "playwright"]` literals (four occurrences across three
  files) to `collect_ignore = ["e2e", "playwright", "meta/e2e"]` to match the canonical
  `tests/conftest.py` template and `docs/E2E_TESTS.md` (already fixed in a prior pass).

### Decisions and Failures

- Hygiene fixtures (`skip_repo_hygiene`, `ascii_fix_enabled`, `pytest_addoption("--no-ascii-fix")`)
  intentionally excluded from the canonical `tests/conftest.py` template. The canonical hygiene
  tests (`test_ascii_compliance.py`, `test_whitespace.py`) read
  `pytestconfig.getoption("no_ascii_fix", default=False)` directly; the fixtures are stale
  leftovers from an earlier design. Excluding them from the template prevents propagation from
  reintroducing orphaned fixtures into consumer repos.

## 2026-06-16

### Additions and New Features

- Added `swift` as a recognized `REPO_TYPE` token (`meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`
  `known_repo_types`, `repolib/model.py` `LANG_SWIFT` / `REPO_TYPE_ORDER` / `KNOWN_REPO_TYPES`).
  `swift` currently ships universal files only (no `templates/swift/` overlay); future swift files
  are added by folder location with no code change. `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` is now the
  single ordered source of truth for the consumer token set; `reset_repo.py` and the propagate
  prompt offer swift as a selectable type (`[s]wift`); `tools/detect_repo_type.py` recognizes
  `Package.swift` (high confidence) and `.swift` file counts.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `repolib/repo.py` `read_repo_type`: unrecognized tokens in `REPO_TYPE` or legacy
  `STARTER_REPO_TYPE` now log a warning (`repo=<name> REPO_TYPE token '<tok>' not recognized;
  treating as other`) and return `other` instead of raising `ValueError`. Previously
  `propagate_style_guides.py -R ../swift-usb-imager` aborted the entire run on the first
  unrecognized marker; the new fallback lets batch propagation continue past a single bad marker.

- `templates/typescript/tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py`: `fetch_latest_versions` now prints
  live `[index/total] pkg: version` progress as each `npm view` round-trip resolves (or a
  `[index/total] skip (not on registry)` line), flushed per line. Previously the script printed
  nothing during the query phase and dumped all resolved versions only after every package
  finished, so a 343-package sweep looked hung. The redundant post-loop print in `main()` was
  removed.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `repolib/repo.py` `read_repo_type`: fixed an `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable
  'repolib'` that crashed `propagate_style_guides.py -R <repo>` on the predict-and-write-marker
  path. The function-scoped `import repolib.model` bound the package name `repolib` as a
  function-local for the whole scope, so earlier `repolib.console.*` references (the
  high-confidence "auto-wrote marker" log line, and the legacy-marker warn line) raised
  `UnboundLocalError`. Hoisted the lazy `import repolib.model` to the top of the function body so
  `repolib` is bound before any use; removed the now-redundant second inline import in the batch
  path. The import stays function-scoped, so the model/repo import cycle remains broken. Latent
  because every previously-processed repo already had a `REPO_TYPE` marker, which takes the early
  file-read return that never touches `repolib`; the crash only fires on `-R` single-repo mode
  with a missing marker plus high-confidence detection.

- `templates/typescript/tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py`: stop crashing on private or
  workspace-local packages that are not published to the npm registry. `npm view <pkg>` returns
  `E404` for such packages (e.g. `@kobalte/tests`); the script previously raised `RuntimeError`
  on the first one and aborted the whole sweep. Now `fetch_latest_version` returns `None` on
  `E404` and `fetch_latest_versions` omits it from the version map, routing it through the
  existing unmanaged-extras path: a `skip (not on registry)` line during the query phase and the
  existing `WARN consumer-extra (unmanaged)` line in the per-target diff. The pin is left
  untouched; never auto-bumped against the public registry. Non-404 npm failures (network, auth)
  still raise. The `main()` resolved-version print loop now guards `pkg in latest` so skipped
  packages do not `KeyError`.

## 2026-06-15

### Additions and New Features

- Added `meta_file_patterns` to `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` (seeded with `docs/CHANGELOG-*.md`):
  a glob-pattern manifest for template-meta files that NEVER ship, sitting beside `meta_files`.
  Loaded as a frozenset via `repolib/manifests.py` (`SET_MANIFEST_KEYS`) and exposed as
  `repolib.model.META_FILE_PATTERNS`. Closes the gap where rotation-archive changelogs
  (`docs/CHANGELOG-YYYY-MM[a-z].md`) shipped universally because only the active
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md` was an exact `meta_files` entry.
- Added `repolib.files.is_meta_file(file_rel)`: the single source of truth for the template-meta
  check (exact `META_FILES` match by rel-path OR basename, plus `META_FILE_PATTERNS` globs).

- Added `tests/meta/e2e/run_all.sh`: offline runner that iterates over every `e2e_*` script under
  `tests/meta/e2e/` and reports pass/fail for each. Runs LOCAL mode only; does not invoke REMOTE.
- Added `tests/meta/test_reset_config.py`: fast offline pytest coverage for `reset_repo.py`
  config parsing and the folder-name guard. Covers required-key validation, alias normalization
  (short tokens for project_type and code_license), optional-key defaults, and the
  `starter-repo-template` basename rejection.
- WP9 (`templates/python/_pypi/` overlay): moved `submit_to_pypi.py` from `devel/` into
  `templates/python/_pypi/devel/` via `git mv` so the file location gates whether it ships to
  consumer repos. Added a minimal `templates/python/_pypi/noexist/pyproject.toml` stub
  (`[project]` table with `name = "PROJECT_NAME"` and CalVer `version = "26.06"`) that the
  reset interview will later use to seed the marker file.
- WP14 (`reset_repo.py`): added the PyPI reset interview. After a python type is chosen, the
  interactive interview asks `Will this Python project be published as a pypi package? [y/N]:`
  (default no). On yes, a new seed phase runs strictly before propagation: `seed_pyproject()`
  copies `templates/python/_pypi/noexist/pyproject.toml` to the repo root when absent and writes
  a synced `VERSION` file holding the same `[project] version` string (read from the stub). This
  makes `repolib.model.select_overlay_dirs` include `python/_pypi`, so `submit_to_pypi.py` ships
  in the same reset. `--dry-run` logs the seed without writing. CLI exposes only
  `-h/--dry-run/--config`; all choices (type, licenses, PyPI, stage, commit) are handled
  by the interactive interview or the JSON config file.
- WP10 (`meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`): added the single source of propagation config as a
  template-meta YAML data file (never ships). It holds every propagation manifest that
  `repolib/model.py` previously defined as a Python literal: `routing_overrides`,
  `conditional_overlays`, and the set/sequence manifests (`root_propagate_allowlist`,
  `universal_noexist`, `merge_files`, `meta_files`, `meta_dirs`, `skip_walk_dirs`,
  `auto_discover_docs_exclude`, `meta_test_prefixes`, `default_repo_skip_names`). Values match the
  prior literals exactly.
- WP11 (`repolib/manifests.py`): added `load_manifests(template_root)`, which reads
  `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` with `yaml.safe_load` and returns the same Python types
  `model.py` exposed (set manifests as `frozenset`, `meta_test_prefixes` as a tuple,
  `routing_overrides` as a dict with `frozenset` `exclude_repos`, `conditional_overlays` as the
  nested dict). A missing file or non-mapping YAML raises loudly (no empty fallback).
- WP18 (`meta/docs/HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md`): expanded the single-line stub into a full durable
  guidance file covering location-primary routing, `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` holds only `exclude_repos`,
  `_folder` conditional overlay convention, `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` as single source of
  truth, `reset_repo.py` interactive-first design, test-follows-live-config pattern, and the
  prefer-rule-based-over-per-file preference. Linked from `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md`
  (meta-to-meta link; `AGENTS.md` does not link to `meta/` because that path does not exist in
  consumer repos).

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `reset_repo.py` `confirm_plan` summary now prints the resolved `pypi:` choice
  alongside type/code/docs/stage/commit/mode, so an interactive user sees the one
  reset decision that controls whether `pyproject.toml` is seeded and the
  `_pypi` overlay applies before confirming.
- `tests/` propagation routing changed from an enumerated allowlist to a denylist in
  `repolib/files.py`. The universal walk now ships every non-meta `tests/` file by location;
  it skips only dotfiles, `_`-prefixed scratch files, `conftest.py` (still owned by
  `merge_conftest`, not bucket-routed), and `META_TEST_PREFIXES`. A non-`test_`-prefixed
  helper such as `tests/helper_thing.py` now ships, where the old allowlist would have
  dropped it.
- `reset_repo.py` gained `--config <file>`: a JSON answer file drives a non-interactive reset.
  Required keys: `project_type` (python/typescript/rust/other, short alias accepted) and
  `code_license` (SPDX or alias). Optional keys with defaults: `docs_license` (CC-BY-4.0),
  `pypi` (false, python-only), `stage` (true), `commit` (false). Config mode is the
  testing/reproducibility interface; interactive interview remains the human default.
- `reset_repo.py` CLI shrank to `--config`, `--dry-run`, and `-h`. Removed `--force`
  (confirmed no use by the human user) and `--yes` (non-interactive path now uses `--config`).
- `reset_repo.py` folder-name guard: refuses to run when the repo root basename is exactly
  `starter-repo-template`. Protects the template development checkout from accidental
  destruction. Guard is folder-name only; no remote or origin inspection.
- `reset_repo.py` now exits with a clear message when run outside a git repository instead of
  emitting a raw subprocess traceback.
- `tests/meta/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py` reworked: uses `git clone` into consumer-named `/tmp` dirs
  instead of driving the interactive interview via stdin. Two modes: LOCAL (default, offline,
  clones committed history only) and REMOTE (GitHub HTTPS, opt-in via `remote` argument,
  GitHub HTTPS clone read-only). Per-case ephemeral JSON config; verified against the live
  propagation engine plus reset-specific anchor checks.
- WP14 (`reset_repo.py`): the keep/remove decision for `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` now derives from
  `repolib.model.select_overlay_dirs(project_type, repo_root)` (the same overlay-selection rule the
  propagator uses) instead of the old `project_type != "python"` check. A python repo without a
  `pyproject.toml` now correctly drops the tool, which the old check missed. The next-step hint now
  lists the dependency files actually present per type: python lists both `pip_requirements.txt`
  and the universal `pip_requirements-dev.txt`; typescript, rust, and other types now also list the
  universal `pip_requirements-dev.txt`.
- WP17 (propagation routing): file location is now the primary routing determinant. `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md`
  ships universally to all repo types (previously restricted to python repos by a `language` gate in
  `ROUTING_OVERRIDES`). `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` ships via the `_pypi` conditional overlay
  (previously gated by `language + requires_repo_file` in `ROUTING_OVERRIDES`).
  `pip_requirements-dev.txt` ships universally (root allowlist + universal noexist).
- `devel/DEVEL_README.md`: shortened the folder README from script-help-style function
  inventories into a quick summary of what belongs in `devel/`, with a compact current-script
  table and a note that type-specific developer helpers live under `templates/<type>/devel/`.
- `devel/flatten_broken_md_links.py`: added `-i`/`--input` file mode (`nargs='+'`) and
  `-n`/`--dry-run`. Accepts one or more paths or glob patterns; patterns are expanded in
  Python via `glob.glob`, so quoted globs work even when the shell does not expand them
  (for example `-i 'devel/*.md'`). In this mode `--apply` is the default (writes the files);
  pass `--dry-run` to preview only. Directory mode is unchanged: dry-run by default, `--apply`
  to write. Extracted the per-file loop and summary printer into a shared `run_files()` helper
  used by both modes.

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `reset_repo.py` git calls now resolve against the resolved `repo_root` instead
  of the launch directory. `git_rm`/`git_rm_recursive` gained a `repo_root`
  parameter and pass `cwd=repo_root`; the meta-dir-walk `git ls-files` and the
  `git add -A`/`git commit`/`git status --short` calls also pass `cwd=repo_root`,
  matching the existing `templates/` and `tools/` calls. File-copy ops already
  used absolute `repo_root` paths; this removes the prior inconsistency where a
  reset launched from a subdirectory would copy files correctly but fail the
  `git rm` cleanup pathspecs.
- `reset_repo.py` typescript `package.json` version substitution now zero-pads the
  month (`f"{now.year}.{now.month:02d}.0"`, e.g. `2026.06.0`) to match the
  zero-padded CalVer convention in `docs/REPO_STYLE.md`.
- `reset_repo.py` license-copy-failure rollback hint now names the offending file
  with per-file `git restore --staged <file>` / `git restore <file>` wording,
  replacing the wholesale `git restore .` form that the permissions hook blocks.
- Moved reset E2E harness (`tests/e2e/e2e_reset_routing.py`) and its runner
  (`tests/e2e/run_all.sh`) to `tests/meta/e2e/` via `git mv`. The harness tests
  the propagation/reset engine that is removed at consumers and must therefore be
  template-meta. `tests/meta/` is already in `reset_repo.py` `TEMPLATE_OWNED_PREFIXES`
  so these files are now scrubbed by reset and never propagate. Updated
  `docs/E2E_TESTS.md`, `meta/docs/HUMAN_GUIDANCE.md`, and the run-path comment in
  both moved files to reflect the new location.

- Propagation no longer ships changelog rotation archives. Refactored the four duplicated
  meta-check sites in `repolib/files.py` (`assert_not_meta_file`, the universal walk, the
  typed-overlay walk, and the typed-overlay noexist `consumer_path` check) to call the new
  `is_meta_file` helper, which adds `META_FILE_PATTERNS` glob matching on top of the existing
  exact `META_FILES` behavior. Behavior is identical for prior exact-match cases.
- `reset_repo.py` now scrubs changelog archives from a clone: a cleanup step iterates
  `repolib.model.META_FILE_PATTERNS`, globs each pattern under the repo root, and `git rm`s every
  match (respecting `--dry-run`). The patterns are read before `repolib/` is removed. The active
  `docs/CHANGELOG.md` is still truncated.
- Doc-accuracy audit: corrected four stale claims across `README.md`, `docs/USAGE.md`,
  `docs/E2E_TESTS.md`, and `docs/CHANGELOG.md`.
  - `README.md` line 29: replaced removed `--yes` / `--force` flag descriptions with the real
    CLI: `--dry-run` prints planned actions without writing; `--config <file>` runs
    non-interactively from a JSON answer file.
  - `docs/USAGE.md` schema table: replaced fabricated aliases `GPLv3` / `gpl3` (invalid; the
    prefix resolver requires the dash, e.g. `gpl-3.0` not `gpl3`) with real aliases `GPL-3.0`
    and `g`; changed the minimal JSON example from `"GPLv3"` to `"GPL-3.0"`.
  - `docs/E2E_TESTS.md` REMOTE-mode table cell: changed "validates origin/main after push"
    (implied a push) to "GitHub HTTPS clone (read-only); exercises what a consumer receives
    from origin/main", matching the prose notes already corrected previously.
  - `docs/CHANGELOG.md` three bullets in the 2026-06-15 day block that stated reset CLI as
    `-h/--dry-run/--yes/--force`: corrected to `-h/--dry-run/--config` in all three places.

- Rotated `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (exceeded 1000 lines); older day blocks moved to
  [docs/CHANGELOG-2026-06a.md](CHANGELOG-2026-06a.md) (dates 2026-06-11 through 2026-02-14).
- WP11 (`repolib/model.py`): removed the inline manifest literals and now loads them once at
  import from `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` via `repolib.manifests.load_manifests`, assigning
  the same module-level public names (`ROUTING_OVERRIDES`, `CONDITIONAL_OVERLAYS`,
  `ROOT_PROPAGATE_ALLOWLIST`, `UNIVERSAL_NOEXIST`, `MERGE_FILES`, `META_FILES`, `META_DIRS`,
  `SKIP_WALK_DIRS`, `AUTO_DISCOVER_DOCS_EXCLUDE`, `META_TEST_PREFIXES`, `DEFAULT_REPO_SKIP_NAMES`)
  so existing importers and `dir()` keep working. `LANG_*` constants, `PropagateContext`, and the
  path-resolution helpers are unchanged.
- `repolib/repo.py`: moved its `import repolib.model` from module top into `read_repo_type` (the
  only caller) to break a `repolib.model` <-> `repolib.repo` import cycle. `model.py` resolves the
  template root via `repolib.repo.resolve_source_dir` at import; the top-level import left
  `resolve_source_dir` undefined when `repolib.repo` was imported first. Deferring both imports
  fixes every import order.
- Root `pip_requirements.txt`: added `pyyaml` because the propagation engine now imports `yaml`.
  This root manifest is template-meta and does not propagate; the empty consumer seed at
  `templates/python/noexist/pip_requirements.txt` stays empty.
- WP17 (`repolib/repo.py`): fixed stale comments at lines 25-26 and 114-116 that said
  `LANG_UNKNOWN gates language-specific file routing via should_ship_override`. The accurate
  statement is that `LANG_UNKNOWN` means no `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` `exclude_repos` rule applies;
  universal walker-routed files still ship. Comment-only change; no code or logic altered.
- WP17 (`docs/REPO_STYLE.md`): updated the `## Project type marker` paragraph. Replaced the
  stale claim that `other`-typed repos do not receive `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` (that exception was
  removed). Stated that `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` is now a universal doc shipping to all repo types.
  Added location-primary routing summary, `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` holds only `exclude_repos`, and a
  pointer to `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md` for the `_folder` conditional overlay convention.
- WP17 (`meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md`): updated to the location-primary model. Added the
  `_folder` / conditional overlay section with the `_pypi` YAML example. Updated the Hardcoding
  principles section to point at `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml` as the manifest home. Updated
  the Exceptions section (`ROUTING_OVERRIDES` now holds only `exclude_repos`; removed `language`,
  `requires_repo_file`, and `bucket` field documentation). Updated the Routing override gates
  section accordingly. Updated Examples to show `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md` as universal and
  `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` via `_pypi` overlay. Removed the stale `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` python-only
  language gate example.
- `README.md`: removed the Markdown link to `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md` from the Template
  layout section. That path never ships to consumer repos, so the link 404s there. Inlined the
  key fact (manifests live in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`) as prose.
- `docs/CHANGELOG.md`: corrected the WP14 Additions bullet to state the final CLI flag set
  positively (`-h/--dry-run/--config` only; all choices handled by the interactive interview
  or the JSON config file) instead of listing removed flags.
- `repolib/model.py` `find_source_for_bucket`: fixed devel-bucket source resolution to search
  typed/overlay roots before the universal root, mirroring overwrite-bucket precedence. A
  consumer-modified `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` is now correctly refreshed from
  `templates/python/_pypi/` during a single-repo reset instead of resolving to the consumer's
  own stale file.
- `reset_repo.py`: the PyPI=no cleanup of `devel/submit_to_pypi.py` now uses a forced removal so
  a just-refreshed working-tree copy is reliably removed when the `_pypi` overlay does not apply.
- Docs: removed the shipped-markdown link from `README.md` that pointed to
  `meta/docs/PROPAGATION_RULES.md`; shipped markdown no longer links to local meta files so
  consumer links stay valid. Corrected a CHANGELOG WP-era bullet that described removed reset
  flags; reset CLI is interactive-first with only `-h/--dry-run/--config`.
- Cleanup: removed the unused `LANG_UNIVERSAL` constant; fixed a stale "five-bucket" docstring
  (now six) in `repolib/files.py`; tightened the manifest-loader override schema test to assert
  `frozenset`; added missing import-section headings, function separators, and a `parse_args`
  docstring; corrected a `parse_repo_type_choice` type hint.

### Removals and Deprecations

- `reset_repo.py` `--force` flag removed; the human user confirmed it has no use.
- `reset_repo.py` `--yes` flag removed; config mode (`--config`) is the non-interactive path.
- Removed the redundant empty root `pip_requirements.txt`. The propagation manifest seed for
  python consumers is `templates/python/noexist/pip_requirements.txt`; the template's `pyyaml`
  tooling dependency is declared in the template-only `pip_requirements-meta.txt`.
- WP17 (`ROUTING_OVERRIDES`): removed `language`, `requires_repo_file`, and `bucket` fields from
  `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` in `meta/propagation/manifests.yaml`. These per-file gates are replaced by
  location-based routing: typed overlay folders (`templates/<type>/`) handle language specificity
  and `_folder` conditional overlays (with `has_file` rules) handle `requires_repo_file` cases.
  The `bucket` shorthand is no longer needed because location already determines noexist/overwrite
  classification. `ROUTING_OVERRIDES` now holds only `exclude_repos` exceptions.

### Decisions and Failures

- Removed the over-engineered `tests/` allowlist: per docs/REPO_STYLE.md location is the primary
  routing determinant. An audit showed the enumerated allowlist
  (`test_*`/`check_*`/`fix_*`/`file_utils.py`/`TESTS_README.md`) excluded only one tracked
  `tests/` file in practice -- `conftest.py` -- which is already handled by `merge_conftest`. The
  denylist replaces the enumeration with three code-level skips (dotfiles, `_`-scratch,
  `conftest.py`) plus the existing `META_TEST_PREFIXES`. `conftest.py` stays merge-owned and is
  deliberately NOT routed to `noexist`.
- Config format is JSON (stdlib `json`, no extra deps): chosen because config files are
  short-lived machine fixtures generated per test case, not human-authored YAML. JSON also avoids
  adding a `pyyaml` dependency at the `reset_repo.py` level.
- Guard uses folder name only (no remote or origin slug inspection): remote-slug detection was
  rejected as fragile -- a cloned consumer repo may temporarily keep the template remote before
  renaming. Folder name is deterministic and sufficient.
- `--force` removal confirmed by the human user: the flag had no use case that config mode does
  not already cover.

## 2026-06-12

### Additions and New Features

- Added `file_utils.clear_stale_reports() -> None` (WP0b): deletes all `report_*.txt` files at
  the repo root; guarded once per process via a module-level flag so multiple hygiene modules
  in the same session each invoke it but only the first does filesystem work. Replaces the
  per-module `purge_report` call that previously ran before every fixture, which caused
  stale-report races when modules ran in parallel.
- Added `file_utils.collect_file_violations`, `collect_python_violations`,
  `format_violation_report`, `format_violation_assert_message`, `write_report_lines`, and
  `rel_id` to the shared harness (WP1): canonical helpers for the precompute-fixture pattern.
  `collect_python_violations` parses each `.py` file once into an AST and records `SyntaxError`
  entries for unparseable files; `collect_file_violations` delegates parsing to the checker.
  `format_violation_assert_message` is evaluated only on failure so passing cases pay no cost.
  `rel_id` wraps `rel_to_root` for direct use as `ids=file_utils.rel_id` in parametrize.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- `templates/typescript/tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py`: flipped the default mode to
  apply (write changes back). `-a`/`--apply` now sets `dry_run=False` (still accepted, redundant
  with the new default); added `-n`/`--dry-run` to preview the per-target diff and write nothing.
  Default ships to typescript consumer repos as a write-by-default pin bump.
- `sync_typescript_package_pins.py`: broadened scope from `devDependencies` only to both
  `dependencies` and `devDependencies` (new `DEP_SECTIONS` constant). The diff now groups bumps
  under per-section `[dependencies]` / `[devDependencies]` headers, and `collect_devdep_keys` was
  renamed to `collect_dep_keys`. The tool still rewrites `package.json` only; after an apply run
  it prints the follow-up `npm install` (lockfile regen) and `npm audit` commands rather than
  editing `package-lock.json` or `node_modules`, which npm owns.
- Migrated 11 plan hygiene modules (WP1 + WP2) plus `tests/test_init_files.py` (finished as
  obvious follow-on) to the shared harness: autouse module-scope `collect_report` fixture,
  `VIOLATIONS_BY_FILE: dict[str, list[str]]` precomputed once, `write_report_lines` called only
  when violations exist, `clear_stale_reports` as fixture first line. Per-file parametrized tests
  use plain `assert rel not in VIOLATIONS_BY_FILE`. No `raise AssertionError` or `pytest.fail(`
  in any migrated hygiene module. `tests/test_whitespace.py` initially stayed on the legacy
  per-file raise pattern but was subsequently migrated in this same change set (see bullet below).
- Migrated `tests/test_whitespace.py` to the canonical hygiene harness as a user-approved
  follow-on: `collect_file_violations`, module-level `VIOLATIONS_BY_FILE`, autouse
  `collect_report` fixture (the `fix_whitespace.py` auto-fix pass moved from per-test to
  fixture-level, still gated on `--no_ascii_fix`), `rel_id` parametrize ids, standard
  `format_violation_assert_message` asserts, and a new `report_whitespace.txt` report on
  violations.
- Report file formats normalized to a single header line per violation: legacy second-level
  subheaders (`Violations:` in import_dot/import_star/import_requirements, `Parse errors:` block
  grouping in import_requirements, the category-grouped layout in shebangs) were intentionally
  dropped or restructured to one-violation-per-line keyed by file. All violation information is
  preserved; only the grouping structure changed.
- Performance: expensive scanners (bandit JSON subprocess, batched pyflakes, tracked-file sets,
  ASCII fixer pass) run once in the precompute fixture and distribute results by file. Failure
  messages are built only on failure. Suite now ~990 cases in ~3.1s (hard gate: 30s; target:
  10s). Measured via `pytest tests/ --durations=50`, median of 3 clean runs.
- `-k <file>` is now meaningful suite-wide: because the fixture precomputes all violations,
  a `-k tests/foo.py` run selects only that file's per-file assert cases across all hygiene
  modules while still scanning every file and writing complete reports for any module that
  has violations. Partial reports are no longer possible.
- Relocated `tests/test_test_naming_conventions.py` to
  `templates/typescript/tests/test_test_naming_conventions.py` (WP0c) via `git mv`: the test
  targets `tests/e2e/` and `tests/playwright/` subtrees present only in TypeScript repos; in
  this Python repo all checks early-skipped and the module was inert. It now ships only to
  `REPO_TYPE=typescript` consumer repos.
- Renamed `PropagateContext` field `bootstrap` -> `initial_setup` (parameters, docstrings, log
  messages); batch propagation behavior is identical with `initial_setup=False`. Updated all
  callers in `repolib/`, `reset_repo.py`, `tests/meta/test_propagate_cli.py`, and
  `tests/meta/test_repolib_helpers.py`.
- `reset_repo.py` cleanup now also removes `templates/` after propagation and gitignore merge
  have read from it; absent or untracked `templates/` is handled cleanly. Two new end-state
  checks added: `verify_scaffold_sentinel` (per-type sentinel file -- typescript:
  `eslint.config.js`, python: `docs/PYTHON_STYLE.md`) and `verify_clean_end_state` (raises
  listing any leftover `templates/`, `repolib/`, `LICENSES/`, `meta/`, or `tests/meta/` paths
  found in `git ls-files` or on disk). Note: `tools/` is intentionally not in this list -- see
  the later same-day standard-change entry; typed-overlay `tools/` files may legitimately
  remain on a consumer after cleanup.
- New propagation standard: every file under `templates/<type>/` ships to consumers of that
  type, at its path relative to `templates/<type>/`, including `tools/` subpaths. The
  typed-overlay walker (`repolib/files.py` step 2) no longer trims the `tools`/`meta`
  directories or filters subdirectories against `META_DIRS`; only the `META_FILES`
  basename/path guard remains (so a stray `templates/<type>/README.md` cannot clobber a
  consumer README). Split `assert_not_meta` into `assert_not_meta` (strict: also rejects
  `META_DIRS` traversal, used by the universal walk for ROOT `tools/` infrastructure) and
  `assert_not_meta_file` (`META_FILES`-only, used by typed-overlay appends and the apply-time
  dispatcher in `repolib/process.py`) so legitimate consumer `tools/` paths are not rejected.
  The ROOT `tools/` directory (template infrastructure, e.g. `tools/detect_repo_type.py`) is
  unchanged: it never ships and is removed at reset.
- Relocated `sync_typescript_package_pins.py` to `templates/typescript/tools/` (user `git mv`);
  under the new standard it now ships to typescript consumers at
  `tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py`. This supersedes this morning's entry that described
  it shipping via the devel bucket to `devel/`: the file lives under `tools/`, not `devel/`,
  and reaches consumers through the typed overlay. Docstring updated to the new location and a
  Run example of `python3 tools/sync_typescript_package_pins.py [--apply]` (CWD-anchored).
- `reset_repo.py` end-state verification: removed `tools/` from `TEMPLATE_OWNED_PREFIXES`.
  Consumers may now legitimately receive `tools/` files from the typed overlay, so a `tools/`
  directory remaining after cleanup must not fail `verify_clean_end_state`. The cleanup-phase
  `git rm -r tools/` still removes the template's own tracked root `tools/` (e.g.
  `tools/detect_repo_type.py`); it removes tracked entries only, so freshly propagated untracked
  `tools/` files survive. The `git rm -r tools/` step now guards on tracked content (logs and
  skips when `tools/` holds only untracked propagated files) instead of failing on a no-match
  pathspec, mirroring the existing `templates/` handling.
- Moved `run_web_server.sh` from `templates/typescript/noexist/` to
  `templates/typescript/run_web_server.sh` (overwrite/always-propagate bucket) via `git mv`,
  reversing the prior audit decision at CHANGELOG.md:478 that placed it in `noexist/` for
  per-consumer port choice. Rationale: the port is now random with a `PORT` override and the
  fleet shows consumers do not customize the file, so the hardened script can always overwrite.
  Propagation routing verified (WP-A2): `compute_propagation_plan` typed-overlay walk (step 2,
  `repolib/files.py:1018-1025`) routes every non-special-prefix file under `templates/<type>/`
  to `overwrite_files` at its relative path; `run_web_server.sh` at the `templates/typescript/`
  root has no `noexist/`, `devel/`, or `tests/` prefix and is not a META file, so it lands in
  `overwrite_files` as `run_web_server.sh` and ships to every TypeScript consumer on every
  propagation run. Consumer-impact summary (WP-A2): 2 of 6 deployed copies diverged --
  `stem-lesson-quiz-game` had a comment-only rewrite of the header and a different
  setup-missing error message (`setup_game.sh` reference instead of `devel/setup_typescript.sh`);
  `virtual-lab-protocol-simulation` had the auto-install path already present (bare
  `bash devel/setup_typescript.sh`, no existence guard) plus comment-only diffs. Neither
  carries any logic not already folded into the canonical hardened script by WP-A1. Overwrite
  is safe; nothing of value is lost. `pytest tests/` confirmed green: 1032 passed in 2.04s
  (includes `tests/test_shebangs.py` and `tests/meta/` routing tests). Doc link
  `templates/typescript/docs/TYPESCRIPT_STYLE.md:269` (`../run_web_server.sh`) resolves to
  the new location. `templates/typescript/noexist/package.json` `"serve": "./run_web_server.sh"`
  still points at the consumer-root script (package.json stays in `noexist/`; unchanged).
  (WP-A1/WP-A2)
- `run_web_server.sh` auto-install: on missing `node_modules` the script now runs
  `bash devel/setup_typescript.sh` (when present) instead of erroring; if the setup script is
  missing it exits with a helpful message. Folds in the `virtual-lab-protocol-simulation`
  consumer's useful divergence. Reported separately from the lifecycle fix so future setup
  debugging is easy. (WP-A1)

### Fixes and Maintenance

- `run_web_server.sh` lifecycle fix: added an idempotent cleanup `trap` on EXIT/INT/TERM/HUP that
  kills only the http.server child and the script's own browser-open helper (own-child-only; no
  `pkill`/`pgrep`/`ps` scanning, no PID file). The server now starts in the background with its
  PID captured and `wait`ed on, and cleanup preserves the real exit status. Stops the script from
  leaving orphaned `http.server` processes when a backgrounded launcher's parent shell dies.
  Caveat: the trap only fires for trappable signals; `SIGKILL` and some shell-death cases remain
  out of scope. (WP-A1/WP-A2)
- Bumped the `esbuild` devDependency floor in `templates/typescript/noexist/package.json` from
  `>=0.28.0` to `>=0.28.1` to clear GHSA esbuild dev-server path-traversal (affected
  `>=0.27.3, <0.28.1`, patched `0.28.1`). No real exposure for this repo (the build uses
  `npx esbuild --bundle`, not the `--servedir` dev server; the bug is Windows-only; GitHub Pages
  output is static), but the prior floor `0.28.0` sat one patch inside the advisory window.
  Dependabot's separate "no lockfile" notice is per-consumer: run `npm install` and commit the
  generated `package-lock.json` in the affected consumer repo.
- Changed `file_utils.run_fixer_script(script_name, target)` contract: function now
  returns `(returncode: int, stderr: str)` for every subprocess completion and never raises on a
  non-zero exit code. Previously it raised `AssertionError` on any non-zero exit, which caused
  fixer exit code 2 (success-with-changes in `fix_ascii_compliance.py`) to be treated as a
  failure inside a module-scoped autouse fixture, cascading 565 test errors in consumer repos.
  `RuntimeError` is raised only for environment preconditions: script not found (checked via
  `os.path.isfile` before launch) or `FileNotFoundError` from a missing Python interpreter
  (re-raised as `RuntimeError`). Callers now inspect the return value; exit-code contracts:
  `fix_ascii_compliance.py` 0=clean, 1=issues remain, 2=auto-fixed; `fix_whitespace.py`
  0=clean-or-fixed, 1=missing/no-input. Added `tests/meta/test_file_utils_fixer.py` with
  monkeypatched unit tests covering return codes 2 (regression guard for the cascade bug) and 7
  (unexpected), plus nonexistent script and missing interpreter `RuntimeError` paths. Updated
  `tests/TESTS_README.md` and `docs/PYTEST_STYLE.md` run_fixer_script bullets. Consumer repos
  need propagation via `propagate_style_guides.py` to receive the updated `file_utils.py`.
- Memoized `file_utils.get_repo_root` (process-lifetime `functools.lru_cache`) and the no-pattern whole-repo `list_tracked_files` listing (per-`repo_root` cache; pattern-scoped calls stay uncached), and made the per-file hygiene modules build their failure messages lazily inside the assert (WP0); eliminates per-test `git rev-parse` fanout and collection-time `git ls-files` fanout; pinned by call-count meta tests in `tests/meta/test_file_utils_caching.py`.
- Updated `docs/PYTEST_STYLE.md` hygiene-report section: replaced stale `sync_report` /
  `purge_report` API with the current `write_report_lines` + `clear_stale_reports` shape,
  added the canonical module code example (with TABS), documented the report lifecycle and
  `-k`-independence rule, and updated the additional-helpers list.
- Updated `tests/TESTS_README.md` helper list to match reality: added `collect_file_violations`,
  `collect_python_violations`, `format_violation_report`, `format_violation_assert_message`,
  `write_report_lines`, `rel_id`, and `clear_stale_reports`; removed stale `sync_report` and
  `purge_report` entries.
- Fixed stale reference in `docs/E2E_TESTS.md` "Naming conventions test" section: updated
  `tests/test_test_naming_conventions.py` reference to
  `templates/typescript/tests/test_test_naming_conventions.py` with a note that it ships only
  to TypeScript repos.
- Fixed `reset_repo.py` initial-setup propagation silent no-op in consumer clones:
  `process_repo`'s self-skip guard (template root anchored on `repolib/__file__`) matched the
  consumer repo itself and returned `None`, which `run_propagate` ignored; zero typed-overlay
  files shipped (observed on a typescript consumer: no scaffold, no TYPESCRIPT gitignore block,
  `templates/` left tracked). Fixed by gating the self-skip on the context `initial_setup`
  flag and raising `RuntimeError` in `run_propagate` when `process_repo` returns `None`.
- Relocated `templates/typescript/tools/html_to_pdf.mjs` to
  `templates/typescript/devel/html_to_pdf.mjs` via `git mv` so it ships via the `devel_files`
  bucket (verified in the typescript plan `devel_files` listing). Note: at the time of this move
  typed-overlay `tools/` did not ship, so devel/ was the route to reach consumers; the later
  same-day standard change makes `templates/<type>/tools/` ship directly, but this file remains
  in `devel/` as a deliberate placement.

### Behavior or Interface Changes

- Restored auto-fix behavior in `tests/test_whitespace.py`: the `collect_report` fixture now
  accepts `pytestconfig`, resolves `apply_fix = not pytestconfig.getoption("no_ascii_fix", default=False)`,
  and for each initially-violating file runs `file_utils.run_fixer_script("fix_whitespace.py", abs_path)`
  then re-scans; only files with remaining violations after fixing are recorded in `VIOLATIONS_BY_FILE`.
  This matches the gating convention in `test_ascii_compliance.py` (same option name and default).
  The fixer runs once in the fixture, never inside a parametrized test case.

### Removals and Deprecations

- Removed `templates/typescript/tools/check_css_content_policy.py` from the template: the script
  contains project-specific virtual-lab DOM selectors and is not appropriate for general typescript
  consumers. It stays in its origin repo (virtual-lab) where it belongs. The `check_codebase.sh`
  step 5 `css:policy` gate already uses `[ -f tools/check_css_content_policy.py ]` so consumers
  without the script get a clean SKIP and are unaffected. No stub or replacement ships from the
  template.

- Removed the `css:policy` step from `templates/typescript/check_codebase.sh` (header renumbered):
  a permanently skipped step caused confusion and concern once `check_css_content_policy.py` no
  longer ships; repos that carry their own policy script can add a local step.

- Removed `file_utils.sync_report` and `file_utils.purge_report` (dead code, M3 plan): all 11
  plan modules plus `tests/test_init_files.py` migrated to `write_report_lines` +
  `clear_stale_reports`; zero active callers
  remained. Deleted `tests/meta/test_sync_report.py` (pinned only the removed helpers).
  Updated `tests/TESTS_README.md` and the `write_report_lines` docstring to remove stale
  references.

### Developer Tests and Notes

- Added `tests/meta/test_reset_repo_self_propagation.py` (14 tests): `initial_setup`-on-self
  applies correct buckets, batch self-skip returns `None`, `run_propagate` raises on `None`,
  end-state verifier raises on planted leftovers, scaffold-present + templates-absent ordering
  invariant. Updated `bootstrap=` keyword in `tests/meta/test_propagate_cli.py` and
  `tests/meta/test_repolib_helpers.py`. Suite: 1008 passed.

### Decisions and Failures

- Why the exception channel was rejected for `run_fixer_script`: raising on non-zero exit
  inside a module-scoped autouse fixture errors every parametrized test in the module, not just
  the one file that triggered the fix. Per-file fixer outcomes (clean, needs-fix, fixed,
  unexpected error) belong in per-file report data -- the fixture should collect them and the
  per-file test should assert on them. Using exceptions conflates environment failure (broken
  interpreter, missing script -- genuine RuntimeError territory) with normal fixer output
  (non-zero exit is a documented, meaningful result). The return-tuple contract makes the
  distinction explicit and puts outcome handling in the right place.
- Root cause of the reset_repo initial-setup no-op: regression introduced when `reset_repo.py`
  switched from shelling out to `propagate_style_guides.py` to calling `repolib` directly; the
  batch-mode self-skip guard was correct for batch propagation but silently disabled the entire
  initial-setup use case. E2E in `/tmp` scratch clones confirmed all 18 typescript files land
  and the TYPESCRIPT gitignore block is written. Full live exit-0 run requires a committed HEAD
  (uncommitted-overlay clones cause `git rm` to refuse modified files -- test-setup artifact,
  not a product bug).
